# Security Adoption Framework

The Security Adoption Framework (SAF) guides organizations through end-to-end security modernization from a strategic and programmatic level through architectural and technical planning.

:::image type="content" source="media/adoption/security-workshops.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the components of the security adoption framework series workshops." lightbox="media/adoption/security-workshops.png":::

Microsoft continues to invest in this guidance to help organizations as they navigate today's continuously changing security landscape. This guidance can be used in parts or as a whole to guide a full end-to-end security modernization across a 'hybrid of everything' multicloud and multi-platform technical estate.

This guidance applies Zero Trust principles to all aspects of end-to-end security modernization.

## Objectives

This content enables executive leaders, architects, and technical practitioners to build and execute an integrated strategy and architecture that aligns security to your organization through business, security, and technical platform needs. Organizations can accelerate both business enablement and security risk reduction by enabling an agile security approach. This agile approach to security provides flexibility to adapt to the continuously evolving attacks, changing business requirements, and technology platform changes you face today.

Stakeholders at all levels are included to help them understand how to guide and execute this security modernization journey. Organizations can accelerate their modernization using these best practices, lessons learned, and references based on real world examples.

## How to consume the guidance

The publicly available elements of this framework include:

Security Adoption Framework (SAF)**What**: The Security Adoption Framework (SAF) guides organizations through an end-to-end security modernization from strategy and program level through architecture and technical planning using Zero Trust principles.**Why**: Organizations often struggle with planning and prioritizing security modernization in the face of continuously changing threats, technology platforms, and business processes. These workshops help customers rapidly increase security posture & align security to business priorities in this challenging environment.  **How**: The SAF is a series of Microsoft Unified Engagements that help customers navigate the full set of challenges they face by providing guidance and references (strategy, plans, prioritization criteria, and more) based on best practices and lessons learned.  SAF engagements help customers decide what to do first, next, and later in security and allow organizations to start from multiple different perspectives including:​- **Getting Started** - Default starting point for customers (and account teams) who are not sure where to start on security- **Product Adoption** - Evaluate and plan Microsoft security product/feature usage (often focused on Microsoft 365 [E5] license usage) with the Security Capability - **End to End Security**  - **Technical Architecture** - Using Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA), Zero Trust principles, and other security models, frameworks, and guidance.   - **Strategy and Program** - Using the CISO Workshop to guide an overall security modernization- **Architectures and Technical Plans** for Security Modernization Initiatives including:SAF engagements are based on general principles and approaches to security and use Microsoft technology as examples. This helps customers get value out of the engagements whether or not they are already familliar with Microsoft security technology. ﻿## Security Adoption Framework (SAF) EngagementsSAF engagements take the form of shorter engagements (1-4 hour _Topic Summaries_) and longer planning sessions (1-3 day _Security Architecture Design Sessions (ADSes)_)
