# Security Adoption Resources

Customers continue to ask for help with navigating the continuously changing security landscape. Microsoft is investing in this area with guidance based on industry standards and principles that help enable your organization to achieve more. This guidance can be used in parts or as a whole to guide a full end-to-end security modernization across a 'hybrid of everything' multicloud and multi-platform technical estate.

The Security Adoption Framework (SAF) guides organizations through end-to-end security modernization from a strategic and programmatic level through architectural and technical planning.

This guidance applies Zero Trust principles to all aspects of end-to-end security modernization.

## Objectives

This content enables executive leaders, architects, and technical practitioners to build and execute an integrated strategy and architecture that aligns security to your organization through business, security, and technical platform needs. Organizations can accelerate both business enablement and security risk reduction by enabling an agile security approach. This agile approach to security provides flexibility to adapt to the continuously evolving attacks, changing business requirements, and technology platform changes you face today.

Stakeholders at all levels are included to help them understand how to guide and execute this security modernization journey. Organizations can accelerate their modernization using these best practices, lessons learned, and references based on real world examples.

## How to consume the guidance

The publicly available elements of this framework include:

### Microsoft led workshops

You might choose to have a Microsoft expert lead a comprehensive version of this framework to guide your organization through any or all of the workshops. That Microsoft led experience covers the full security modernization lifecycle from program and strategy through to technical architecture, complemented by implementation and optimization tailored to you. These engagements typically last from a few hours to several days in length as described in the following section.

## Microsoft Unified engagements

A full Microsoft Unified engagement includes the following items:

| Use Case | Title and Description | Summary | Full Workshop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Getting Started** <br> _(Start here if you don't know where to start)_| **Overview and Scoping** - This short conversation is like a 'trail head’ to help you pick the best path to get started with security modernization planning based on your current needs and priorities. | Four hours | - |
| **Product Adoption** | **Security Capability Adoption Planning** helps you maximize value from your current product licenses and entitlements by providing an overview of these Microsoft product capabilities. This session includes a prioritization and planning exercise to rapidly get the most security benefit out of the capabilities you have access to. This overview often includes Microsoft 365 E5 and Microsoft Unified. | - | Two days |
| **End to End Technical Architecture** |**Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)** provide guidance on end to end technical architectures including a summary of Microsoft security capabilities, integration, and more. Based on aka.ms/MCRA. The **Security Architecture Design Session (ADS) Module 1** guides you through more architectural context including: guiding principles, a 'Rosetta Stone' of security models, cross-discipline integrated scenarios, shared responsibility models, technical plans, and more. | Four hours <br> (MCRA) | Two Days <br> (Security ADS 1) |
| **Strategy and Program** | The CISO workshop enables senior security and technology leaders to accelerate security strategy and program modernization with best practices and lessons learned. The workshop covers all aspects of a comprehensive security program including: recommended strategic initiatives, roles and responsibilities guidance, reference success metrics, maturity models, Zero Trust principles, and more. Based on aka.ms/CISOWorkshop. | Four hours | Custom scope |
| **Access Control** (Identity, Network, and more) | **Security ADS Module 2  - Secure Identities and Access** provides guidance for planning and architecting access control to secure access to a 'hybrid of everything' modern enterprise, mitigate attacks on privileged accounts, and integrate identity and network access strategies together. <br> <br> The full workshop, currently in development, provides more detail on: policy-driven adaptive access control integrating identity, network, and other access controls; maturity models; success criteria; recommended technical architectures; a Microsoft case study; and a planning exercise to map out your journey by tailoring reference plans to your unique needs. | Four hours | TBD when available |
| **Security Operations (SecOps/SOC)** | **Security ADS Module 3 - Modern Security Operations (SecOps/SOC)** provides guidance for modernizing SecOps strategy, processes, architecture, and technology to address the simultaneous challenges of rapidly evolving threat actors, covering a 'hybrid of everything' technical estate, aligning SecOps to business goals, mitigating analyst fatigue/burnout, and more. <br> <br> The full workshop provides more detail on: attacks and incident response; recommended processes and metrics; putting an XDR + SIEM + Security Data Lake Strategy into action; a Microsoft case study; advanced functions including threat hunting, detection engineering, incident management, and threat intelligence; outsourcing considerations; and a planning exercise to map out your journey. | Four hours | 2-3 days |
| **Infrastructure & Development / DevSecOps Security** | **Security ADS Module 4 - Infrastructure & Development Security** provides guidance for planning and architecting infrastructure and development security for multicloud environments, including how to address the simultaneous challenges of rapidly evolving infrastructure, security of workloads and applications as you develop them, and how to build a teamwork-oriented DevSecOps approach for keeping up with rapidly evolving threats, technology, and business requirements. <br> <br>The full workshop, currently in development, provides more detail on models, methodologies, and technologies to modernize infrastructure & development security. | Four hours | TBD when available |
| **Data Security & Governance** | **Security ADS Module 5 - Data Security & Governance** provides guidance for planning and architecting a lifecycle approach for protecting and governing data in today’s complex world. <br> <br> The full workshop, currently in development, provides more detail on models, methodologies, and technologies to modernize information protection and governance | Four hours | TBD when available |
